- list of directories and files hain jinko move ya copy karna hai. 
- Consider move as just copy + deletion step. 
- At the end of copy, we want to generate logs and prompt the user to decide what he wants to do if some of the ops have failed. 
- Maybe let them have a revert option. 


RAW COPYING 
- directory structure replicate karlo pehle so that on the fly directories na banani pade writing time pe. Probably this is the part where I can setup progress measuring stuff as well. 
- walk every directory and queue the files individually for re-writing. 
- for each of these files, maintain a success or failure log in a map. 
- Finally generate the log of failed files and ask the frontend to present it as it sees fit. 
- Completion pe event emit kar sakte hain. 
- Fir jab frontend confirm kar de ki haan mai satisfied hu, tab same starting data me har jageh remove ya removeAll call kar do.

Options
- io.Copy, io.CopyBuffer, os.Read and os.Write. 
- Lets go with io.CopyBuffer kyunki simpler lag rha hai.

FRONTEND 
- just do normal frontend select and send information to backend that a particular element has been 
selected. For Now lets use Ctrl + Click interaction as the only way to select a file.
- Lets add a copy and paste button in the sidebar bottom for testing purposes.
